# React-Pokedex

... WORK IN PROGRESS

## Commits:

### Why origin/main:
 I'm an advocate of using dev branches and creating safe "places" for the experimental work, however as this is a small project and I'm working on my own I decided to use just one branch to keep things simple.
### Commit progress:

	1. First commit with the starter react application basic boilerplate
	2. Download of Material UI library so I can focus on the logic 
	3. Added Roboto font that matches the UI library and removed unnecesary boilerplate in the css files
	4. Used MUI's ImageList compoment to render the pokemons in a tile based manner

## DISCLAIMER
This is a experimental application done on my own for study purposes. Trademarks and copyrights for third-party the Pokemon games and characters are owned by NINTENDO.
