# React-Pokedex

... WORK IN PROGRESS

## Commits:

### Why origin/main:
 I'm an advocate of using dev branches and creating safe "places" for the experimental work, however as this is a small project and I'm working on my own I decided to use just one branch to keep things simple.
### Commit progress:

	1. First commit with the starter react application basic boilerplate
	2. Download of Material UI library so I can focus on the logic 
	3. Added Roboto font that matches the UI library and removed unnecesary boilerplate in the css files
	4. Used MUI's ImageList compoment to render the pokemons in a tile based manner
	5. Substituded grid pokemon listing with table listing for complexity reasons, added axios dependency to retrieve API data
	6. Added pokemon details component (dialog) and we get to see selected pokemon stats with a background color
	
	...
	
#### Todo
 1. store local data 
 2. Add offline functionality
